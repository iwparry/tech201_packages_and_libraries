# API Requests
API stands for application programming interface, and it is how two or more pieces of software are able to communicate with one another.
### What is an API?
An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to communicate using a set of definitions and protocols. 
APIs are an accessible way to extract and share data within and across organizations.

An everyday example of how an API is used is the weather app on your phone, your app "talks" to a Weather Channel system via APIs in order to show you daily weather updates.

An API is necessary for communication between two applications because those applications might not understand each other.
Suppose you have one person who speaks English and another who speaks French, but neither can speak each other's language, how are they supposed to communicate?
Via a translator who acts as an intermediary to the conversation.
That is somewhat the purpose of an API.
